# FizzBuzz assignment

We want to write a Java program that prints the numbers from 1 to n to the "standard" output stream and follows these rules.

- For multiples of 3 it prints _Fizz_ instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5 it prints _Buzz_ instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 it prints _FizzBuzz_.
